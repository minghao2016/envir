\usage{
attach_eval(
  unquoted_expr,
  name = "local:utils",
  pos = 2L,
  warn.conflicts = TRUE,
  ...,
  expr = substitute(unquoted_expr),
  mask.ok = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unquoted_expr}{The expression to be evaluated, This is automatically
quoted.}

\item{name}{The environment name. If an environment of that name already
exists, it is reused, otherwise, a new environment is attached.}

\item{pos}{The position where to attach the environment, if creating a new
one. If an environment of \code{name} already exists, \code{pos} is ignored.}

\item{warn.conflicts}{logical. If TRUE (the default), print warnings about
objects in the attached environment that that are masking or masked by
other objects of the same name.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{expr}{A R language object. This is an escape hatch from the automatic
quoting of \code{unquoted_expr}.}

\item{mask.ok}{character vector of names of objects that can mask objects on
the search path without signaling a warning if \code{warn.conflicts} is \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
the attached environment, invisibly.

attach_eval({
  my_helper_funct <- function(x, y) x + y
